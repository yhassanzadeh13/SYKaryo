# SYKaryo
This project is about sorting Karyotypes in a way that the result is self-explanatory. Karyotypes means the number and visual appearance of the chromosomes in the cell nuclei of an organism or species. Most of the time (almost always) Karyotypes contain chromosomes positioned in a disordered manner i.e. they are rotated, they have overlap and there is no predefined and uniform distribution for them and etc.
